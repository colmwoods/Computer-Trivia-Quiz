## UX

The strategy was to create an **easy-to-navigate, visually engaging gym website**. It should:  

- Attract new members with clear membership plans.  
- Showcase available gym equipment to inspire confidence and know what they expect .  
- Provide practical info (location, opening hours, contact details).  
- Allow users to submit forms with their membership plans. 

### Colour Scheme

- `#0b089e` – Primary background (hero + membership section)  
- `#ffffff` – Main text + background for cards  
- `#000000` – Logo and key typography  
- Accent: Red (`#ff0000`) for **X** in logo 

## User Stories
